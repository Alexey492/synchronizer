The program in the background synchronizes files / folders from the send folder to the destination folder.

Run the program from main.
By default the address of the folder from which data is copied: "./output/src"
In the "./output/src" folder the data can be replaced with any of your own.
By default the address of the folder where synchronization takes place: "./output/dst"".
If necessary you can change the synchronization addresses in the main file.

Tests are in the test folder, all program logic is in the logic folder.
